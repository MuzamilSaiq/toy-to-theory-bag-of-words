# toy-to-theory-bag-of-words
A concise pedagogical walkthrough of Bag-of-Words—from toy intuition to a fully working text-vectorization pipeline. Built from scratch to show how raw text becomes numerical features for machine-learning models.

### What's Inside
- Tokenization & vocabulary construction
- Bag-of-Words counts and feature vectors
- Pure-Python implementation (fast and transparent)
- Comparison with scikit-learn’s `CountVectorizer`

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- NumPy
